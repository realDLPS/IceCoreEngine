# IceCore Engine
A simplistic 2D game engine I am creating for my own needs.

- Clear documentation

### Feature goals
- Pathfinding
- Fast 2D collision
- Easy sprite rendering (Movable camera with zooming and such)
- Unreal inspired actors that have a location in the scene

### What is not planned
- An editor
- 3D
