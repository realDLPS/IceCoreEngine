# IceCore Engine
A simplistic 2D game engine I am creating for my own needs and as a learning exercise.

### Personal goals
- Learn engine programming
- Create and publish a game using this engine on Steam
- Clear documentation

### Feature goals
- Pathfinding
- Fast 2D collision
- Easy sprite rendering (Movable camera with zooming and such)
- Unreal inspired actors that have a location in the scene
- Input
- Sounds
- UI
- File IO?
- P2P networking?

### What is not planned
- An editor
- 3D

### File extension
I plan to use the extension ".ictxt" for file loading. It can be pronounced as "Icy text" or "IceCore text".
It is just a plain text extension to help with players feeling the need to mess with ".txt" files. No real protection is offered though.

And yes, I chose this extension because it happened to sound cool.
